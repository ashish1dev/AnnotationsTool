#########################CHIME Dataset##########################

The figures of the CHIME dataset were originally collected by 
the Center for Information Mining and Extraction (CHIME), 
School of Computing, National University of Singapore. 
The original dataset and an associated description can be found
here: https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tancl/ChartImageDataset.htm

The dataset here contains the ground truth information in TSV
and JSON format, which is only a transformed version of the 
original ground truth information that was provided in XML and
TXT format.
Please note, that the original ground truth did not contain
any separately coded information about the orientation of the 
text elements. Thus, all elements are by default at horizontal
orientation, which leads to some inconsistency in the dataset.
